##CLEANING/EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
##Following data sets all characters to actual dates and NA's
cardata$signup_date<-as.Date(cardata$signup_date,"%Y-%m-%d")
cardata$bgc_date <- as.Date(cardata$bgc_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
cardata$vehicle_added_date <- as.Date(cardata$vehicle_added_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
cardata$first_completed_date <- as.Date(cardata$first_completed_date,"%Y-%m-%d")
cardata$vehicle_year = as.integer(cardata$vehicle_year)

## removed all the data that is faulty 
## ie) had NA for vehicle added date and had non-NA values for vehicle make,model and year
cardata <- cardata[!(is.na(cardata$vehicle_added_date) == TRUE & (is.na(cardata$vehicle_make) == FALSE | 
                                  is.na(cardata$vehicle_model) == FALSE | is.na(cardata$vehicle_year) == FALSE)),]

## Adds a column saying whether first ride is completed or not completed
cardata = mutate(cardata, Completed = factor(ifelse(is.na(completed) == TRUE, "not completed","completed")))

## Counting how many people completed background check, added their vehicle, and made their first trip
bgcCompleted = nrow(cardata) - sum(is.na(cardata$bgc_date))
vehicleaddedCompleted = nrow(cardata) - sum(is.na(cardata$vehicle_added_date))
completedCount =nrow(cardata) - sum(is.na(cardata$first_completed_date))
completedCount/nrow(cardata)
## 11.2416% of people that signed up made their first trip
logit = glm(Completed ~ ., data = cardata, family = "binomial")
## Tried to use logistic regression model since it works via classification

cartree = tree(Completed ~ ., data = cardata)
draw.tree(cartree)

##auxiliary variables amount of days between each sign up and the frequency of these days
cardata$su_bgc <- cardata$bgc_date - cardata$signup_date
cardata$su_bgc <- as.integer(cardata$su_bgc)

cardata$su_c <- cardata$first_completed_date - cardata$signup_date
cardata$su_c <- as.integer(cardata$su_c)
num_signups_event <- c(bgcCompleted, vehicleaddedCompleted, completedCount)
##histograms of frequence in which time between signups and other important dates such as
## background check date, vehicle added date and the date of first completed ride
hist(cardata$su_bgc, main = "Histogram of the time between signups and background check")
hist(cardata$su_v, main = "Histogram of the time between signups and vehicle added date")
hist(cardata$su_c, main = "Histogram of the time between signups and first completed date")
barplot(num_signups_event, main = "Count for number of people that completed bgc, added vehicle and
        first ride completed")
##Very clear that through the data that there is a signifcant drop in people between signup and 
##background check, signup and vehicle added and signup and first completed date.
## In addition the frequencey of the days become closer and closer throughout the dates as
## the difference between each milestone day 
plot(cardata$Completed,cardata$su_bgc)
plot(cardata$Completed,cardata$su_v)
## Shows that the number of completed has some correlation with how fast the back ground check
## was completed

##using these graphs that show the relations between the number of completed first trips 
##and the difference in days between sign up and back ground check, sign up and date vehicle added
## and difference between day of completion.
